# aoc - Advent of Code scaffolding generator 

I found I was doing the exact same thing to start every day of Advent of Code, so I figured I could automate it.

## Installation

`go get github.com/gholtslander-va/aoc`

## Usage

Go to the folder you are doing your Advent of Code in and run

`aoc start <day number>`

If you are using Golang, it will generate go by default. If you want something else, use the language flag:

`aoc start <day number> -l python`

And it will generate python files.
